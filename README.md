## PyCity School Data

### Goal
Use school-level and student-level data to elucidate differnces and find relationships between charter and district schools, test scores, budget, and grade level. 

### Observations
1. School's math and reading scores remain mostly steady between grade levels, not changing more than one to two percentage points. 
2. Charter schools and district schools rates of students passing math and reading are largely similar, with an overall passing rate difference of only 1.83% (84.25% charter, 86.08% district) and spend nearly the same on students ($622 charter, $617.86 district).
